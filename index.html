            <p>
               One winter in tha year 1842 when Kya was a young girl, a snowstorm buried the whole village for weeks.
               A month later, Kya noticed she hadn't seen her friend Nini since the storm.
               So Kya and some others went to check on Nini's family. When they got there, no one was home.
               Just a fire flickering in the fireplace. While the men went out to search, Kya stayed in the house.
               When she was alone, she heard a voice. "It's so cold and I can't get warm!"
               Kya turned and saw Nini standing by the fire. She was blue like she was frozen.
               Kya ran outside for help, but when everyone came back, Nini was gone.
               Where'd she go, you might ask? NO ONE KNOWS. Nini's house stands empty to this day, but sometimes, 
               people see smoke coming up from the chimney, like little Nini is still trying to get warm. 
               The gang is interrupted by a suspicious old lady in the woods. 
               The old lady introduces herself as Hama and offers them a place to sleep for the night.

            <h2>Meeting Hama</h2>


            <p>
               The next morning Hama went out to do some shopping, 
               Back at hama's house the gang got curious about hama so they explore some of her house.
               while thay where exploring they find a locked room. Toph unlocked the room and they found a treasure box inside.
               They started to open the treasure box, "What do you think you're doing?" they were startled by Hama behind them. 
               The gang apologize for snooping. Hama suddenly took the treasure box out of their hands and started to open it, 
               she opened the box for them and said it was her most precious treasure.
               What Hama pulls out of the box is an old Southern water tribe comb. </p>

            <h2>Hama's History</h2>

            <p>
               Hama explains that she's a water bender from the southern water tribe. 
               Katara and the gang are surprised since they've never met another water bender from the southern water tribe before.
               Hama continues telling them her story, She explain how  60 years ago when the fire Nation raids first started they would come again and again,
               each time rounding up more water benders and taking them captive.
               she was the last water bender left when they came and stole her from her home.
               Katara and Sokka Express their sympathy, As their mother was also taken during a fire nation raid.
               Hama then brightens up the mood again and give them a nice dinner and offers to teach katara some of her water bending tricks she's learned over the years.
               Delighted Katara accepts Hama's offer.

            <h2>Hama's Lesson</h2>

            <p>
               The next day, Hama takes katara out to a field of lilies to practice some water bending.
               She starts demonstrating a water bedding technique she's been practicing,
               Hama then sucks the water right out of the flowers in the field.
               Katara was really impressed but then expressed some sadness about the Dead flowers.
               Hama Then States "they're just flowers. When you're a water bender away from home, you do what you must to survive.
               Later tonight katara I will show you the ultimate technique of waterbending but
                it can only be done during the full moon when our bending is at its peak". The two exist the garden.

            <h2>The Full Story</h2>


            <p>Later that night under a bright full moon. Hama states to katara.
               " what I'm about to show you I discovered in that wretched fire Nation prison...
               The guards were always very careful to keep any water away from the water bender prisoners. 
               They piped in dry air and had a suspended away from the ground before giving us any water.
               They would bind our hands and feet so we couldn't bend.
               Any sign of trouble was met with crule retribution and yet each month,
               I felt the full moon enriching me with its energy, there had to be something I could do to escape.
               Then I realized that where there is life, there is water the rats that scurried across the floor of my cage
               where nothing more than skins filled with liquid. I spent years developing the skill that would lead to my escape.
               BLOODBENDING.</p>

               <p> Controlling the water in another body and forcing your own will over theirs.
               Once I had mastered the rats I was ready for the men." Hama continues.
               " As a fire nation guard was strolling past my cage I started to use blood bending on him,
               I force the guard to grab hold of his keys and unlock my cell thus making my escape.
               And during the next full moon I walked free for the first time in DECADES.
               My cell unlocked by the very guards assigned to keep me in.
               Once you perfect this technique katara you can control anything or ANYONE."
            </p>

            <h2>BLOODBENDING</h2>

            <p>
               Katara unsure and apprehensive says. "But.. to reach inside someone and control them I don't know if I want that kind of power"
               Hama answers "when you're at war you do whatever it takes whatever you have to do to survive.
               They took me from my home and imprisoned me with my brothers and sisters waiting for us to rot they don't deserve any Mercy.
               For years I've been using this gift to take my revenge one by one killing as many Fire Nation scum 
               as I can and now I will teach you to continue my work and help rid the world of the Fire Nation". 
               Katara angrily States "I won't! I won't use blood bending and I won't allow you to keep hurting people."
               Grinning Hama replies "you should have learned the technique before you turned against me."
            </p>

            <p>
               Katara then loses control of her body as Hama uses blood bending to control her.
               " It's impossible to fight your way out of my grip, I control every muscle every vein in your body"
               with swift motions of her arms and hands, hama uses blood bending to twist katara around and throw her from side to side, 
               she then positions katara directly before her and use a downward motion of her hand to force her into a submissive state.
               A tearful katara begs hama to stop. But Hama only laughs and keeps katara subdued.
               Several moments pass and katara starts to break free from Hama's grip. Hama stairs in shock as katara inhales deeply and rises, now free from her grip.
               Katara then states "You're not the only one who draws power from the moon! My bending is more powerful than yours, hama. You're technique is useless on me!"

            <p>
               The two start fighting using water bending to strike each other and Katara is winning.
               She gets Hama on her knees but then, Suddenly sokka and aang approache the scene as Hama raises up.
               The gang seeing the fight tries to help katara. Hama then begins blood bending aang and sokka. Hama forces them to come at each other with weapons.
               Katara horrified yells "NO!". Katara with an unsure look on her face starts to blood bend, forcing Hama to the ground.
               The gang then binds her hands together so she can no longer fight. Aang says "you're going to be locked away forever."
               Hama with a wide grin on her face answers "my work is done. Congratulations, Katara. YOU'RE A BLOOD BENDER."
