               One winter in tha year 1842 when Kya was a young girl, a snowstorm buried the whole village for weeks.
               A month later, Kya noticed she hadn't seen her friend Nini since the storm.
               So Kya and some others went to check on Nini's family. When they got there, no one was home.
               Just a fire flickering in the fireplace. While the men went out to search, Kya stayed in the house.
               When she was alone, she heard a voice. "It's so cold and I can't get warm!"
               Kya turned and saw Nini standing by the fire. She was blue like she was frozen.
               Kya ran outside for help, but when everyone came back, Nini was gone.
               Where'd she go, you might ask? NO ONE KNOWS. Nini's house stands empty to this day, but sometimes, 
               people see smoke coming up from the chimney, like little Nini is still trying to get warm. 
               The gang is interrupted by a suspicious old lady in the woods. 
               The old lady introduces herself as Hama and offers them a place to sleep for the night.

            <h2>Meeting Hama</h2>


            <p>
               The next morning Hama went out to do some shopping, 
               Back at hama's house the gang got curious about hama so they explore some of her house.
               while thay where exploring they find a locked room. Toph unlocked the room and they found a treasure box inside.
               They started to open the treasure box, "What do you think you're doing?" they were startled by Hama behind them. 
               The gang apologize for snooping. Hama suddenly took the treasure box out of their hands and started to open it, 
               she opened the box for them and said it was her most precious treasure.
               What Hama pulls out of the box is an old Southern water tribe comb. </p>

            <h2>Hama's History</h2>

            <p>
               Hama explains that she's a water bender from the southern water tribe. 
               Katara and the gang are surprised since they've never met another water bender from the southern water tribe before.
               Hama continues telling them her story, She explain how  60 years ago when the fire Nation raids first started they would come again and again,
               each time rounding up more water benders and taking them captive.
               she was the last water bender left when they came and stole her from her home.
               Katara and Sokka Express their sympathy, As their mother was also taken during a fire nation raid.
               Hama then brightens up the mood again and give them a nice dinner and offers to teach katara some of her water bending tricks she's learned over the years.
               Delighted Katara accepts Hama's offer.
